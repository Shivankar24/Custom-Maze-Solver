# Custom-Maze-Solver

a maze solver using admissible heuristic functions; the maze involved a dice,
with only customized moves allowed by rolling it, starting from the initial state, which
had 1 on top, and then reaching the final state position again with one on top, without
any intermediate move having 6 on top ever.
